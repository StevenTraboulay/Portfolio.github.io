Addendum:
The real challenges of this assignment lay in the fractured material online which is not cohesive and not at all easy to follow, missing information and jumping to parts that do not make sense for a new student.
Also, Tutors that advise they do not know a certain thing and are unfamiliar with it.  Then tell you that the solution provided by the school doesn't work.  
And proven to not work when executed as well. We as students had to get the answers online (which is fine, but given that this course is supposed to help us I don't see how this was helpful)
The challenges here as well were that the lessons in animations and grids online were not adequate to provide us the tools to complete this so the real challenge of this week was to show the course was
moot, as we're clearly self learning 90% of this save for the 2 lecture times a week.
