# Portfolio.github.io


Task:
To create a portfolio of our work
showing our accomplishments and start to finish.
it is meant as an introduction site to grow.
This will be meant as a virtual resume of sorts to showcase our cases and entice employers.

Requirements:
Name
A recent photo
links to section of myself, work and how to contact me
links should navigate and workcs
UI should scroll to sections
Showcase of applications
images should be clickable
resizing should be usable via responsive application

Issues:
the advanced levels of CSS and grids were difficult to address. 
Time constraints to code from scratch a new site in a day given lesson size.
size and fitting pictures in
overcome by googling and contacting colleagues. 

Addendum:
The real challenges of this assignment lay in the fractured material online which is not cohesive and not at all easy to follow, missing information and jumping to parts that do not make sense for a new student.
Tutor was unable to help as he mentioned that he didn't know the code requested to help, which is odd as they're supposed to be our resources when we don't know where to turn.
And proven to not work when executed as well. We as students had to get the answers online (which is fine, but given that this course is supposed to help us I don't see how this was helpful)
The challenges here as well were that the lessons in animations and grids online were not adequate to provide us the tools to complete this so the real challenge of this week was to show the course was
moot, as we're clearly self learning 90% of this save for the 2 lecture times a week.
The only saving grace here is from John Wang, the instructor- who has more than gone out of his way to help us.  Otherwise - the UofT provided materials are absolutely terrible.
